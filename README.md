# ELDEN RING HKS repository

As of now, this is just a place to put the latest `c0000.hks` file compatible for ELDEN RING.

The `c0000.hks` file is the HavokScript file serving as an interface between player inputs and the player character.

The HKS is decompiled using the various assorted forks of [katalash's DSLuaDecompiler](https://github.com/katalash/DSLuaDecompiler), then cleaned and manually fixed up (mostly by Vawser) due to the decompiler's outdated state and imperfect output.

With input by the community this project may grow in scope.

The `main` branch holds the current fixed HKS, while the `decomp` branch holds the latest raw decompile of the HKS for comparisons.
