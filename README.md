# ELDEN RING HKS repository

Contains various HKS files for ELDEN RING.

HKS (HavokScript) serves as an interface between player/AI inputs and influences the animations and behavior of the respective chr model.

* `c0000.hks`: The interface between player inputs and the player character.
* `c8000.hks`: The HavokScript file for Torrent.
* `c9997.hks`: A HavokScript file applying to all enemies.

The HKS is decompiled using the various assorted forks of [katalash's DSLuaDecompiler](https://github.com/katalash/DSLuaDecompiler), then cleaned and manually fixed up (mostly by Vawser) due to the decompiler's outdated state and imperfect output.

With input by the community this project may grow in scope.
